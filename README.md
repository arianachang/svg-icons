# svg-icons
SVG Files for Drawing on the Web

This project was extended from Wazir's original icon system.  

[Original Icon Repository](https://github.com/Waz1215/svg-icons)

### Each icon corresponds to a different holiday: 
### Heart = Valentine's Day 
### Clover = St. Patrick's 
### Egg Basket = Easter 
### Fireworks = Independence Day 
### Pumpkin = Halloween 
### Turkey = Thanksgiving 
### Tree = Christmas
### _Menorah = Hanukkah_

The icon I added was the Menorah SVG file, created with Inkscape.
